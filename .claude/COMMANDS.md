## Tips

### Command Usage
- Commands are conversational agents, not templates
- Answer questions thoughtfully to get better output
- Use scratchpads to persist context across sessions
- Don't rush - explore thoroughly before finalizing

### Documentation Flow
- Core docs (charter, PRD, ADD, WBS) → rarely change
- Specs → written before implementation
- Features → written after implementation
- Plans → active work in progress
- Scratchpad → temporary (clean up regularly)
- Logs → problems and resolutions

### Integration with Claude Code
- Commands appear as skills in Claude Code
- Invoke using: `/<command-name>`
- Commands have access to project context
- Follow command guidance - they're domain experts

### When in Doubt
- Start with project charter if new project
- Start with task spec if implementing feature
- Check GETTING_STARTED.md for workflows
- Use decision tree above to navigate
