# Getting Started: Agentic Coding Blueprint Workflow

This guide walks you through starting a new project from scratch using AI-assisted development principles.

## Overview

The workflow follows a **spec-driven development** approach:

```
Business Vision → Product Requirements → System Architecture → Task Breakdown → Implementation → Review → Deploy
```

Each phase has dedicated Claude Code commands to guide you through conversations that generate documentation.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Development (Business Foundation)

### Step 1: Generate Project Charter

**Command:** `/01_pre_dev:01_generate_project_charter`

## Tips for Success

### Maximize AI Effectiveness
- Read existing code before asking AI to modify
- Provide context through CLAUDE.md files
- Use type hints everywhere (mandatory)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Favor simple over clever

### Documentation Strategy
- Core docs (charter, PRD, ADD, WBS) are foundation
- Specs are written before code
- Features are documented after implementation
- Plans track current work
- Scratchpad is temporary (clean up regularly)
- Logs capture problems and solutions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: isolated component testing
- Integration tests: multi-component workflows (requires Docker)
- Evals: LLM output quality testing
- Run specific test types: `uv run pytest tests/<type>/ -v`

### Git Workflow
- Commit after each completed task
- Include WBS task ID in commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update docs in same commit as code changes

### When Stuck
- Check docs/CLAUDE.md for guidance
- Review existing code patterns in app/
- Use scratchpad to organize thoughts
- Generate task spec to clarify approach
- Ask AI to explain existing code
